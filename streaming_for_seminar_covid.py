Access to twitter's real-time streams

Connects to twitter's real-time streams for random sample and tracking streams

Requirements:
    - depends on authentication module auth.py
    - libraries request

Twitter's real-time tweet streams
=================================

The streaming api delivers a continuous stream of incoming tweets - either from a random sample or matching given criteria - and thus follows different paradigms than the REST api. Instead of performing multiple independent requests, a stream is connected once. The connection stays alive as long as both sides keep it open and transports tweets as they are coming in. Under the hood, streams are still http connections, which means they have response headers, are initiated via GET or POST requests and terminate with a status code. There are some idiosyncracies to watch out for:

- Stream connections can exist for a very long time, but don't need to transfer data all along. A filter stream for rarely used words, for example, can go minutes or even hours without yielding a tweet. Usually, both server and client would terminate the connection if they don't receive anything for that long, so twitter periodically sends a "keepalive" signal.
- Just like REST requests, streams are rate-limited. Twitter restricts the amount of tweets delivered via the random sample stream and via tracking streams. A complete stream containing all tweets and a tracking stream that guarantees to deliver all matching tweets are only available commercially via twitter's data broker `gnip`_. Take note that all free sample streams are identical: Connecting multiple times is prohibited and yields no additional data.
- Even though streams are designed to stay open, there are numerous reasons why they can end. It's helpful to distinguish stream termination in two phases: (1) Failures to connect result in an http `error status code`_. For example, if you try to connect with invalid tokens, the connection ends with a status code of 401. (2) Failures *during streaming* instead try to send a `failure explanation`_ before disconnecting. The most common causes for disconnects are connection issues on the users' or twitter's side (such as a restart of the server delivering the stream).
- Twitter provides some very helpful metadata while the stream is running. In between tweets, you will see blank lines as keepalive data, delete notices broadcasting the IDs of deleted tweets and warnings if your application is not fast enough to keep up with the stream. From a scientific point of view, the most important metadata are *limit notices*. Lines such as this::

    {'limit': {'timestamp_ms': '1443095140794', 'track': 16}}

 tell your application, that as of the given timestamp, your tracking stream has omitted 16 matching tweets. Short of buying access, it's not possible to know what exactly was omitted. Still, tracking limit notices allows researchers to roughly quantify the coverage of their tracking data.


Implementation Details
----------------------

Any application that connects to the streaming API needs to somehow interleave connection handling and the actual processing of tweets. There are many ways to go about this: It would be possible, for example, to set up two separate programs, even on different machines, and pass the stream between them. This would be a modular and performant design, but introduces  complexity and additional opportunities for failure. Instead, we opted to use a simple unified design.

In this module, you will find a function for setting up either a random sample or a tracking stream. In addition to the sample/tracking parameters, it takes *two functions* as optional arguments: One function for handling tweets and one for handling non-tweet messages. This design is  called "callback" - our stream handling code hands a tweet over to some processing function which then hands control back to the stream handler.

**It is absolutely vital that the code processing tweets does so quickly.** While the callback functions do their work, the main function is paused and cannot process incoming data. If your code takes too long, twitter will disconnect the stream and - if that happens too often - disable your API access altogether. So make sure you only perform the absolute minimum work while streaming. Post-processing is best handled after the data collection.
